Study Design

The raw data for this project came from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  Please see the following links for information about the data and to download the zip if desired.

The relevant raw data is split between 6 different files:
subject_train.txt	training set subject label data
X_train.txt			training set measurement data
y_train.txt			training set activity label data
subject_test.txt	test set subject label data
X_test.txt			test set measurement data
y_test.txt			test set activity label data

This project combined the data into one data set, and the requirement was to then extract only the mean and standard deviation measurements.  Then the mean of each selected
measurement was calculated for each subject and activity.

For my design, the requirement of including only mean and standard deviation measurements meant that I only included those features with "mean()" or "std()" in the original feature name.
- Those measurements labeled as meanFreq() (mean frequency) were not included, as they are not a direct mean measurement.  Rather, they are a frequency measurement.
- Similary, the angle measurements related to mean were not included, as they are a measurement of the angle between two vectors, not a mean.
Both of these are considered to be derivative calculations, not direct mean calculations, and as such were not included.

In total, 66 mean and standard deviation features were included (see the Code Book section for further details on the included features).

The activity label data in the raw data files only contains the numeric ID mapped to each activity.  For the sake of readability, the character names for each activity
are used in the final data set.  This is based on the activity_labels.txt file included in the raw data zip.

The requirement was to take the mean of each included feature for each subject and activity.  This results in 180 records in the final data set (30 subjects x 6 activities each).
In addition to the 66 features, there is a column for the subject ID and one for the activity name, so there are 68 columns.  The dimensions of the final data set are then 180 x 68.

Code Book

A list of all 561 features in the raw data files can be found in the features.txt file of the raw data zip.  Additionally, a description of the features and the data collection can be found
in the features_info.txt file of the raw data zip.  Below is a list of the 66 mean and standard deviation features that were included as part of this project.  The list contains the 
feature ID, the original feature name, and a cleaned-up feature name that is used in the final tidy data frame.  (Extraneous parenthesis and dashes were removed.)

Please note that the data points taken from the phones were in the following units:
acceleration - standard gravity unit (g)
velocity - radians / second

However, the feature data from the zip file that was used for this project had already been normalized, so the units no longer directly apply.
